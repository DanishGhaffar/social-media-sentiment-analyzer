    "title": "CMV: Israel\u2019s attack on Iran was intended to draw the US into war, not prevent Iran from having a nuke",
    "text": "Israel claims its attack on Iran on Friday was about preventing Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons. I think that this is a pretty transparent lie for the reasons below.\n\nIsrael has been claiming Iran has been close to a nuclear weapon for 30 years. North Korea is significantly less advanced than Iran, but has successfully developed a nuke during that time period. \n\nIran previously had a nuclear weapon program. That ended in 2003 to avoid getting attacked by the US. Since then, it looks like it\u2019s strategy has been to use its nuclear capability for deterrence. (\u201cstop fucking with us; we can build a nuke pretty quickly\u201d)\n\nIt is clear that Iran does not want a conflict with the United States. Openly weaponizing their nuclear program invites that conflict. \n\nOf course, they could pursue weaponization in secret. But the US, UK and Israel knowingly misrepresented evidence of WMD prior to the Iraq war. It is more than fair for the public to demand proof of weaponization since one party in this conflict has previously used this exact same lie as cover for regime change.\n\nIsrael does not have the ability to inflict significant damage to Iran\u2019s nuclear program or pursue regime change in Iran on its own. Even if they had the capability to destroy Fordow, the enriched uranium is almost certainly spread out across the country. If Iran\u2019s entire nuclear program including the uranium were destroyed, it could still develop a bomb in under 5 years.\n\nThe only ways to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuke is convincing the regime that a nuke is not in their best interest or changing the regime. \n\nIt\u2019s still early, but it seems like Israel\u2019s attack has made the idea of having a nuke more appealing to Iranians and the regime. It looks like having a nuke is the only way to deter Israel and its allies.\n\nSo why would Israel attack Iran? I think the most straightforward answer is they were hoping Iran would retaliate in a manner that forced the US to enter the conflict and pursue regime change.\n\nIran hasn\u2019t taken the bait, so now Israel is attempting to present Iran as neutered by their campaign. \u201cIran is weak. Come over and help us finish the job\u201d\n\nIran has been weakened, but they clearly have the capability to inflict more damage on Israel than they have demonstrated. The threat of offensive US involvement has constrained their response.\n\nOnce the US attacks, Iran will no longer be constrained by the threat of the US joining the conflict and will retaliate on US/ Israeli assets. The US will officially be in an offensive war that it did not initiate. This was Netanyahu\u2019s actual calculation before Friday.\n\nMy view can be changed by concrete evidence of Iran\u2019s nuclear weaponization and/or an explanation of how Israel thinks this bombing campaign will prevent Iran from pursuing a nuke without US involvement.\n\nTL;DR: Israel doesn\u2019t have the capability to meaningfully impact Iran\u2019s nuclear program or pursue regime change on its own. They attacked Iran hoping that they could provoke a strong response that would draw the US into the conflict. \n\nEdit: my view is not related to whether or not their attacks on Iran were justified or strategically sound. My view is the reason for attack was a lie. I don\u2019t think Iran should have nuclear weapons. I just also don\u2019t believe they were actively developing them.",

This month, the foreign ministers of the Persian Gulf states met for the first time as a group with their Iranian counterpart. It is a shaky, early-stage rapprochement that will only chip away at centuries of sectarian antagonisms, but it represents a sharp shift in a region where the rivalry between Riyadh and Tehran has drenched the region in bloodshed for decades.\n\nTehran\u2019s outreach continued after that, with the Iranian foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, visiting Saudi Arabia before heading to other countries in the region, including Iraq and Oman, in an effort to ease tensions. He also visited Jordan before traveling to Egypt and Turkey. The visit to Egypt was the first by an Iranian foreign minister in 12 years.\n\nWhat changed? Images started streaming out of Gaza of children buried alive under rubble, mothers grieving over their dead babies and Palestinians starving because Israel had blocked aid from entering the territory \u2014 all of which made it impossible for the Saudi leadership to ignore the issue of Palestinian statehood.\n\n[Read a copy of the rest of the article here](https://archive.is/DYldd)",

Just enriching uranium, still not to weapons grade though. And tulsi clarified that while enrichment was high, there was no active WMD program since it's ending in 2003. You do know there would be zero incentive for them to attack us without provocation, and really zero possibility, as they don't have ICBMs, right? They were negotiating (before Israel killed all the negotiators, and we bombed them) to get sanctions relief. But now that we attacked them, all bets are off. They have nothing else to really lose and the negotiations are over forever now. They have no leverage now for sanctions relief, and I doubt they will bend the knee and make peace.**\n\n**For decades, their stated reason for hating us is for arming, funding, and supporting Israel, their main rival in the region. A nuclear-capable rival, mind you. Also, for our support of Iraq in the Iran-Iraq war, which greatly hurt their position in the middle east. Oh yea, and backing the Shah all those years. Maybe if we butted out of their business and were more America-first, we wouldn't have as many problems with them.**\n\n**>>>>>We can't be sure of that. Depending on how they hide radiation emissions (such as deep within a mountain), they most certainly could have already reached weapons grade enrichment.**\n\n**Remember, we can't just fly a WC-135 over Iran. Even if we could, they could still hide it.**\n\n**>>>>>>Our intel agencies still assert there is no active weapons program, tulsi just said this, along with the caveat that their enrichment was high, but not weapons grade.

    "text": "The Prof G Podcast produced what the podcast called an \u201cEmergency Episode\u201d on Saturday, June 14 in which Scott Galloway invited Dan Senor, who is described by the podcast as \u201ca leading expert on Israel and the Middle East\u201d, to explain the recent fighting between Israel and Iran.\n\nDan Senor served as a foreign policy advisor to Mitt Romney in his 2012 presidential campaign.\u00a0 Dan has been advocating for Israel to attack Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities since that time.\n\nDan studied at Hebrew University in Jerusalem and his father worked for Israel Bonds, a U.S. underwriter of debt issued by the State of Israel.\u00a0 Bonds issued by Israel and purchased by the American Jewish community were a key financial support for the state of Israel in times of crisis.\n\nSuffice to say, Dan Senor is strongly pro-Israel.\u00a0 He describes people who protest in favor of human rights for Palestinians as \u201cHamas cheerleaders\u201d.\u00a0 I have never seen a Palestinian rights activist express even an ounce of enthusiasm for the actions of Hamas on October 7, but I would characterize Dan\u2019s demeanor throughout the podcast episode as being giddy in talking about the \u201csurprise\u201d attack on Iran by Israel and comparing it to what he called the \u201cspectacular\u201d attack on Iran last October.\u00a0 He comes across as a stronger cheerleader for war and escalation of violence than any campus protestor.\n\nIn describing Israel's aims for the attack.\u00a0 Dan claims that Israel was successful in taking out the leadership and chain of command in the Israeli military necessary to launch missiles as a counter attack against Israel.\u00a0 But this makes no sense really, since Iran did in fact launch a counter attack consisting of hundreds of missiles within hours. \u00a0\n\nThere is no doubt the U.S. had knowledge of the attack.\u00a0 It was reported in the media days before the attack that the U.S. had ordered non-essential personnel out of Iraq due to the possibility of such an attack. \u00a0Dan also claims that the U.S. intentionally deceived Iran into thinking that no attack from Israel would occur before the 6th round of talks on an Iran nuclear agreement which was to take place on Sunday, June 16th. This is a startling accusation that would undermine any remaining credibility the U.S. negotiating team has and I am not sure what reason Iran would have for any further discussion with the Americans.\n\nDan goes on to paint his vision of Israel as a military Goliath that other nations, like Saudi Arabia will now want to partner with because everybody likes a winner.\u00a0 This would be a shocking outcome to me given that Israel has become something more like a pariah state than at any time in their history.\u00a0 To me this vision reveals Dan\u2019s completely delusional view of the how the rest of the world perceives Israel in light of the human tragedy in Gaza.\n\nScott adds to this conversation by describing the great many very American-like Persian people he knows. And what great affinity they have for American culture, and if only there could be a regime change in Iran, America and Iran could have a close relationship.\u00a0 Scott describes himself as a raging Zionist and Dan describes the far-right in America as being overwhelmingly supportive of Israel.\u00a0 If only they could bring the Iranians around to this vision of world peace to help finish off the pesky Palestinian people occupying the last bit of land needed for the dream of greater Israel!\u00a0\n\nI don\u2019t think Scott has very many honest relationships with his Persian friends, because all of the Persians I know, and I know a lot, think the Zionist project is an evil and racist endeavor as does the rest of the Arab world. \u00a0\n\nIsrael\u2019s air superiority over Iran is plain to see and Iran has no real defense.\u00a0 Their only counter is to launch missiles and within days or weeks they will exhaust their arsenal.\u00a0 We are not going to see a ground war between Israel and Iran.\u00a0 Iran has a significant manpower advantage in a ground war, but distance between the countries is too great and Israel could never hold territory in Iran given the vastly greater population of Iran compared to Israel. \u00a0 So this war will start and end with Israel\u00a0 bombing Iran and the only questions are how long it will last, how much it will cost American taxpayers, and whether America will supply all of the bombs to make Tehran look like Gaza.\n\nTowards the end of the conversation, Dan reiterates his belief that violence was always the only option for dealing with Iran and that any attempt at diplomacy is misguided and naive.\u00a0 When people like Dan Senor and Benjamin Netanyahu run the world, violence is the only option because it\u2019s the only thing they believe in.\n\nWhile Dan claims that regime change is not the end goal but also that diplomacy is not a realistic approach for dealing with the Iranian leadership, then like Gaza, there is no end game.\u00a0 Israel will just have to keep bombing Iran every time they get close to either a diplomatic agreement with America or building a nuclear weapon. \u00a0 And from Iran\u2019s perspective the only options are complete surrender or build a nuclear weapon as the only viable deterrent against further attacks.",

    "text": "**Trump's Israel First Administration:**\n\nThe Trump Administration has been the most pro-Israel presidency in the history of the US. The America first movement has been infiltrated by Israeli agents so that the populace would vote to install Trump. They tricked you into thinking that Trump would bring back a second golden age by nativist/nationalist policies like mass deportations for illegals. The reality is that the only deportations that are happening are the pro-Palestine international students who criticised Israel, and some universities were stripped of their funding for not \"addressing antisemitism\".\n\nThat's just one of the many 'Israel First' moves they've done. Most of the GOP is AIPAC funded, his cabinet is for the large part jewish. Trump freezes aid to almost every country except for Israel, which is still receiving billions. There is a video of Trump pushing a chair in for Netanyahu in the White House, showing who's the owner and who's the pet. Not to mention that most of America's elite is jewish.\n\n**The reason why Israel wants Iran gone:**\n\nThe Greater Israel vision is to control the territory \"from the Nile to the Euphrates\" which was promised to them 3,000 years ago, and is the cornerstone to fulfilling the prophecy of the end times. This also coincides with the plans to rebuild the third temple of Solomon to fulfil the biblical prophecies of the apocalypse. US Sec of Defense Pete Hegseth floated the idea around, requiring the destruction of the Al-Aqsa mosque. The 'Greater Israel' vision seems to be adopted in Israel, some IDF soldiers were photographed wearing a patch depicting the expanded borders.\n\nThere is speculation that the state of Israel is the synagogue of Satan, and along with the bible prophecy which they would claim to be 'jews' but are not. Genetic testing in Israel is banned, so there isn't too much research on the genetic history of modern Israel, but prominent jewish leaders originally had European last names (Netanyahu's last name was switched from Mileikowsky), Ashkenazi jews are genetically European and 97.5% of them lack Hebrew DNA. Not to mention the Khazarian mass conversion to judaism which has been shrouded in mystery.\n\nthe Greater Israel plan and subsequent rebuilding of the Solomon temple would require the Arab states of Egypt, Libya, Jordan, Lebanon, Syria, Iraq, Saudi Arabia and Iran severely weakened or have submitted to Israel. So far, most states have toppled by revolutions and wars except Iran. Syria's Assad regime was toppled recently in Dec 2024 by Al-Qaeda, with the terrorist organisation being funded by Israel. Iran is the only state in the region standing that can resist jewish expansion, and Israel will not win a war against Iran.\n\nUS for the most part has no reason to be hostile with Iran. It is on the other side of the world and fighting a war would not benefit the US whatsoever. If Iran had nuclear weapons, it would not reach the US, it would only be in range of Israel.\n\n**Trump's actions against Iran:**\n\nTrump has recently demanded that Iran would sign a 'nuclear deal' which he threatened Iran with \"bombing... which they have never seen before\" if they do not sign it. Iran has responded that it will not accept Trump's 'unrealistic conditions' of the nuclear deal. Trump is trying to find every reason to go to war with Iran, and will need public support for it. Whether it would lead to a world war is another story, as Russia could be pulled into the conflict.\n\nBe aware of astroturfed campaigns to sway you to have a negative opinion of Iran. The 'weapons of mass destruction' in Iraq was fake, and the jewish elites will try to convince you that a war with Iran is justified and will want you to fight their war without sending any troops of their own. Our 'greatest ally' Israel sent ZERO troops to Iraq or Afghanistan.\n\n**Stay on high alert:**\n\nFor now, the only way we can avert a war against Iran is to ensure that we are not goaded into war with Iran. The Trump administration and the jews in power will try to convince us otherwise through their media tactics. Eyes open and keep noticing until we reach critical mass and have the majority of the population aware.",

    "text": "What Are the Bibi Files?\n\nThe \"Bibi Files\" refer to a cache of leaked police interrogation footage and related evidence from the Israeli corruption investigations into Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu (nicknamed \"Bibi\"). These files include thousands of hours of video and audio recordings from interrogations conducted by Israeli police between 2016 and 2018, as well as interviews with Netanyahu\u2019s family, friends, associates, and wealthy benefactors. The footage was leaked to filmmaker Alex Gibney in early 2023 and became the basis for the 2024 documentary film The Bibi Files, directed by Alexis Bloom.\n\nWhy Are the Bibi Files So Damning?\n1. Unprecedented Visual Evidence of Corruption\n\nUnlike prior leaks that only included audio, the Bibi Files provide direct video evidence of Netanyahu and his inner circle being questioned about bribery, fraud, and breach of trust. This footage offers a candid, unfiltered look at Netanyahu\u2019s responses, demeanor, and strategies under pressure, which many observers and filmmakers describe as exposing his \"venal and corrupt character\".\n\n2. Detailed Allegations and Patterns of Misconduct\n\nThe files document allegations that Netanyahu and his family solicited and accepted expensive gifts (champagne, cigars, jewelry) from wealthy businessmen, including Hollywood producer Arnon Milchan and casino magnate Sheldon Adelson, in exchange for political favors and positive media coverage.\n\nThey also detail Netanyahu\u2019s alleged efforts to manipulate Israeli media by offering regulatory benefits to media owners in return for favorable coverage, most notably involving Israel\u2019s largest telecom company and the Walla! News site.\n\n3. Political and Societal Impact\n\nThe documentary and the files argue that Netanyahu\u2019s efforts to stay in power\u2014including controversial alliances with far-right politicians and judicial reforms\u2014are directly linked to his desire to evade prosecution. The film suggests that Netanyahu\u2019s political maneuvers, including the prolonging of the Gaza conflict, serve as tools to maintain his grip on power and delay or avoid legal consequences.\n\n4. Broader Implications for Israeli Democracy\n\nThe files and the documentary draw a direct line between Netanyahu\u2019s personal legal troubles and broader changes in Israeli society and governance, including the erosion of judicial independence and the deepening of national divisions.\n\n5. Attempts at Suppression\n\nNetanyahu attempted to block the release of the documentary in Israel, citing the illegality of broadcasting such interrogation footage, which has only heightened the perception of the files\u2019 significance and their potential to damage his reputation and political future.\n\n\ud83d\udea8The Bibi Files are considered damning because they provide unprecedented, direct evidence of alleged corruption at the highest level of Israeli government, expose the personal and political strategies Netanyahu has used to retain power, and link his legal troubles to broader societal and geopolitical consequences. Their release has intensified scrutiny of Netanyahu\u2019s leadership and raised profound questions about the state of Israeli democracy.\n\n\ud83d\udea9 Israel says Iran tried to assassinate Trump twice.\n\n\ud83d\udea9 Israel says that Iran has nuclear weapons.\n\n\ud83d\udea9 Israel says they did a pre-emptive strike on Iran before peace talks could take place, because Trump knew and authorized the attack. Trump has not refuted this.\n\n\ud83d\udea9 Trump talks about building a \"golden dome\" missile defense system.\n\n\ud83d\udea9 Israel says Iran will attack New York if Tel Aviv is attacked.\n\n\ud83d\udea9 Israel is trying to pull USA into war with every excuse under the sun (and some classic ones too).\n\nHow do I make money off this?\n\nKeep an eye on the government contracts and see who's getting the funding.

OXY is one of the most sensitive and leveraged plays to oil prices, offering asymmetric upside on any major geopolitical shock. Here.\n\n\u2e3b\n\nWHY I LOVE IT:\n\n1. High Beta to Oil Prices\n\t\u2022\tOXY\u2019s earnings and valuation are directly tied to crude prices.\n\t\u2022\tA $10\u2013$15 increase in oil can massively improve cash flows, causing its stock to react with a 2\u20133x multiple of oil price gains.\n\t\u2022\tHistorically, when oil goes up 20%, OXY can go up 40\u201360%+.\n\n2. Warren Buffett Backing = Downside Buffer\n\t\u2022\tBerkshire Hathaway owns ~28% of OXY and keeps buying more under $60.\n\t\u2022\tBuffett\u2019s involvement gives institutional confidence and potential price floor support.\n\t\u2022\tIn a volatile market, this backing protects downside risk while still allowing big upside.\n\n\n3. Operational Leverage & Asset Quality\n\t\u2022\tOXY has top-tier shale assets (Permian Basin) and Middle East exposure.\n\t\u2022\tExtremely efficient cost structure after post-COVID restructuring.\n\t\u2022\tBreak-even cost on production: ~$40/barrel \u2192 high-profit margins at elevated prices.\n\n\n4. Balance Sheet & Shareholder Returns\n\t\u2022\tOXY has paid down over $17B in debt since 2020.\n\t\u2022\tWith higher oil, they can accelerate buybacks and dividends.\n\t\u2022\tShareholder returns are expected to grow rapidly if oil holds above $80.\n\n5. Cheap Valuation\n\t\u2022\tTrades at ~9x forward earnings, below historical averages.\n\t\u2022\tPEG ratio under 1 in many models = undervalued on a growth-adjusted basis.\n\t\u2022\tIf oil jumps, multiple expansion + earnings surge = explosive combo.\n\n6. Options Are Cheap (for Now)\n\t\u2022\tCompared to XOM or CVX, OXY\u2019s call options are much more affordable.\n\t\u2022\tHigher implied volatility = more reward for directional bets.\n\t\u2022\tNovember $50 call at ~$2.15 = great leverage on a move to $55\u2013$60.",

    "text": "Soon I'll write up a nice long Medium for free yet again connecting all the dots building off the extensive research I've been doing along with others in this space in the hopes of waking everyone up and moving us towards a better future.\n\nNo this isn't AI. I've been posting on these subs for years. My name's Craig Oliver, and along with my good friend who I met on here a year ago Michael Armentor aka u/36\\_39\\_42, we're part of a documentary being made by Jon Sumple and Jack Roth of j3Films which is currently in development.\n\n[https://medium.com/@EscapeVelocity1/our-long-in-the-works-magenta-33-documentary-is-a-go-a0748b994443](https://medium.com/@EscapeVelocity1/our-long-in-the-works-magenta-33-documentary-is-a-go-a0748b994443)\n\nWe did an interview about it recently on our buddy Pavel's Psicoactivo podcast:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS-zGxL3UuY&t=3233s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS-zGxL3UuY&t=3233s)\n\nIf you'd like to see some interview clips I thought were notable, you can watch them here:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/@MagentaProject1933](https://www.youtube.com/@MagentaProject1933)\n\nAnd here:\n\n[https://www.tiktok.com/@the.magenta.proje](https://www.tiktok.com/@the.magenta.proje)\n\nAnd whatever else here:\n\n[https://x.com/MagentaUFOUAP](https://x.com/MagentaUFOUAP)\n\nBut that it feels like the world's lost its mind and with the conflict between Israel and Iran and the US's place in the middle of all that, it's time to bridge this gap in quick succession for you all. You can dig through Reddit, through Twitter, through YouTube, and you'll easily find sources for all of this.\n\nThree days ago, journalist Joy Reid made an appearance on an MSNBC roundtable regarding Israel and Iran and the clip went viral:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/LateStageCapitalism/comments/1ljye7e/i\\_know\\_whos\\_getting\\_fired\\_from\\_cnn\\_next/?utm\\_source=share&utm\\_medium=web3x&utm\\_name=web3xcss&utm\\_term=1&utm\\_content=share\\_button](https://www.reddit.com/r/LateStageCapitalism/comments/1ljye7e/i_know_whos_getting_fired_from_cnn_next/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)\n\nNot sure if I can link to Twitter/X, but I'll copy her text below:\n\n>Reid: Why did the Iran hostage crisis take place? \n\n>Todd: Because fundamentalist radicals took over the government \n\n>Reid: They overthrew the shah who we imposed on Iran because the Dulles brothers, one at the CIA and one at the state department, decided that the oil beneath the soil of Iran belonged to BP and belonged to us. And when mossadegh, who was the leader of Iran, the democratically elected leader of Iran, said that we would like to audit BP because we want to know if you are cheating us or paying the people of Iran based on the oil under their soil. And they said, you may not audit us. And then we overthrew him and he wound up dying in prison because we decided in our arrogance as a country, got to own their oil.\n\nYou can read about how the CIA admitted to overthrowing the Shah of Iran in this Guardian article from 2013:\n\n[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/19/cia-admits-role-1953-iranian-coup](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/19/cia-admits-role-1953-iranian-coup)\n\nThose of you who follow this topic closely are very aware of Eisenhower's speech upon leaving office in which he said \"beware the power of the Military Industrial Complex.\" He was referring to the MIC that the Dulles Brothers and James Angleton and the Bush family built after they recovered the 1933 Magenta, Italy UFO in 1944 with the help of the Vatican. Liberation Day in Rome was about this. You can read about how they began building this empire based around this recovery starting here:\n\n[https://medium.com/@EscapeVelocity1/the-ufo-crash-retrieval-story-is-the-biggest-corruption-case-in-modern-history-and-involves-the-83e7b2392f65](https://medium.com/@EscapeVelocity1/the-ufo-crash-retrieval-story-is-the-biggest-corruption-case-in-modern-history-and-involves-the-83e7b2392f65)\n\nTL;DR:\n\nAllen Dulles was lead co-counsel at Brown Brothers Harriman under George H W Bush's father Prescott Bush and Prescott's father and namesake George Herbert Walker. \n\nJames Angleton was living with his family in Milan, Italy in 1933, three miles from where the Magenta craft was recovered. His father James Hughes Angleton was close with Mussolini.\n\nIn 1935, Dulles and fellow Wall Street lawyer Bill Donovan were diplomats who traveled throughout Europe meeting up with the likes of Hitler, Mussolini, and others and making note of how they were developing their armies.\n\nIn 1939, WWII was started by Hitler and Mussolini. In 1940, FDR knew the US would eventually have to join the war and enlisted Bill Donovan to put together an arm of the OSS. Donovan asked his Wall Street friend Dulles to join.\n\nIn 1942 Angleton became the youngest member to join because he'd been witness to the Magenta crash-retrieval.\n\nThe craft was recovered on June 6th, 1944 following the Liberation of Rome and brought to Army R&D on June 21st.\n\nAfter the end of WWII, the OSS was disbanded and the three men hung back in a smaller office.\n\nAfter the UFO crash-retrieval at Roswell, these men would form the CIA, signed into Executive Order the same day as MJ-12 was created, Sept. 24, 1947.\n\nThese are all things you can find on this and other related subs. If anyone cries bullshit, find the source and call them out.\n\nFollowing the Roswell crash-retrieval, the US created the NSA, the CIA, the Air Force, and the DoD. Allen Dulles, Bill Donovan and James Angleton were behind the creation of the CIA. James Forrestal became the first Secretary of Defense.\n\nAt the behest of Prescott Bush, the CIA began recruiting out of his Yale Skull and Bones secret society.\n\nIn 1948, James Angleton helped create the State of Israel as well as their secret nuclear weapons program.\n\nJames Forrestal was also the person who recommended to FDR that MJ-12 be formed. \n\nThe Kennedys were longstanding family friends with the Forrestals and JFK served under Forrestal in WWII. JFK was out sick during the recovery of Magenta, but towards the end of the war, he and Forrestal went to seek out the German secret superweapons. \n\nForrestal was killed in 1949 days before Battelle Institute was set to test the Roswell alloys. He wanted transparency while the Dulles Brothers and the Bush family and Angleton wanted control.\n\nIn 1948, Dulles's Brown Brother Harriman co-counsel Averill Harriman, who was Secretary of Commerce at the time and helped enact the Marshall Plan alongside Dulles's brother John Foster Dulles who was Secretary of State, made Dresser Industries go public with their stock. Dresser Industries specialized in heavy construction machinery. Dulles and Prescott Bush then placed George H W Bush in charge of Dresser Industries and they began building Deep Underground Military Bases.\n\nIn 1951, while Dulles was Deputy Director of the CIA, with the help of the CIA's Thomas Devine would form Zapata Oil and placed George H W Bush in charge. In the 80s when Bush was called out for being involved with the CIA much earlier than anyone thought, in 1961, his spokesperson Thomas Devine refuted the idea.\n\nIn 1952, Washington DC experienced a wave of UFO sighting including the July DC flyovers.\n\nIn 1953, Allen Dulles would become Director of the CIA under the new President Eisenhower, who was instrumental in helping the US win WWII with the help of Dulles at the OSS.\n\nDulles immediately instated Project Blue Book and Project Mockingbird to gaslight the public on UFOs.\n\nDulles also immediately overthrew the Shah of Iran so that British Petroleum would have access to their oil.\n\nIn 1955, Dulles's Yale Skull and Bones buddy Richard Bissell began developing Area 51 and testing out the U-2. It was originally named Watertown after the town where Allen Dulles grew up.\n\nAlso in 1955, the Glenn L Martin Company ousted its founder and formed the Research Institute of Advanced Science. A year later in 1956, the US published an article touting \"The G-Engines are Coming!\"\n\nIn 1957, the Soviet Union surprised the US by launching Sputnik into space. The US scrambled and created NASA in 1958 which relied entirely on Nazi rocket scientists brought over via Operation Paperclip for its endeavors.\n\nIn 1961 when JFK took office, he knew about UFOs and about the CIA's dirty work. He created the DIA in opposition to the CIA. After the Bay of Pigs, he ousted Allen Dulles, who kept working from his home in Georgetown running the CIA in secret. \n\nAround this time, anti-gravity research went completely dark.\n\nIn 1963, JFK sent out a memo stating he wanted full info about UFOs while he was making a deal with Krushev to disarm their nukes and go public about UFOs. Dulles and Angleton and Bush were behind his assassination.\n\nIn 1969, Allen Dulles died in late January.\n\nA week later, SAIC was propped up and all the secret research the CIA had been doing went dark.\n\nBy the end of the year, Project Blue Book was closed. \n\nA year later, the CIA, the Air Force and SAIC all set up shop at Pine Gap in Australia.\n\nFrom there, who fucking knows. Shit got weird.",

    "text": "As the world moves towards yet another potential major conflict, once again in the Middle-East, we on the more radical left shall obviously be largely opposed to involvement of the UK in whatever happens.\n\nFrankly, I'm of the belief that escalation increases the likelyhood of Iran eventually actually getting a nuclear weapon in the longer run. All the talk of a war leading to the end of the Iranian regime is probably wishful thinking, if I'm asked, as bombing a population only strengthens their affinity for their regime (think of the \"rally around the flag\" effect). Essentially, this is going to be a wasteful war, with no real benefit, and I do fear that the UK will get involved in at least some minor way. So to be clear, I am on the side of us staying away from involvement in the Israel-Iran war, and will be protesting as such.\n\nThat said, I KNOW, from mild past experience that a lot of people on the left WILL take these sentiments to an idiotic extreme. That idiotic extreme will lead to stupid, stupid lines being regurgitated. I can predict them now: \"we must stand with the Iranian state\", \"the regime of Iran is fighting western imperialism and is thus worth backing/excusing\", etc. Essentially, the same sort of echo-chamber, one-dimensional rubbish as when the parts of the radical left decided, somehow, that it was OK to directly regurgitate Russian propoganda when they invaded Ukraine.\n\nFor fucks sake, could we not, for once? As much as we will oppose our country's involvement in a pointless war, we don't remotely have to show solidarity with *a dictatorial, theocratic regime, that is after nuclear weapons* (remember, that thing we *also* oppose?). If our collective line starts sounding remotely like that, then we'll only alienate ourselves from the wider UK public, who the militarists will then more easily sway to supporting involvement in the conflict.\n\nTo anybody on the left, who like me, will be out protesting our involvement (preemptively, or as it occurs as events unfold), please, please, please, be careful what you end up agreeing with, and don't blindly follow a line or political personality's take without question.\n\nIf you would care to, focus on this: this war is entirely the product of Donald Trump's BS. HE and his admin ripped up the Iran nuclear deal in 2018, HE purposefully has antagonised Iran in his first term. You can reasonably add Israel's government's actions to the pile of blame, as their strikes against Iran effectively scuppered talks between Iran and European nations on restoring some kind of deal. The more we give attention to those factors, rather than some kind of sense of \"solidarity\" with the Iranian regime, the better chance we have of avoiding involvement by our own nation state.\n\nJust my take, in any case.\n\nEDIT (because I know this will come up): Stating solidarity with the Iranian *people* (not their government) is perfectly fine IMO, by all accounts they widely hate their government.",

Jews have lived in the region for 3000+ years, they\u2019re not going anywhere. Did they expect the world and all the nearby Arab nations to invade Israel as well? How could they honestly think after the horrific events of October 7th the world would still be on their side? None of their wars have had any success whatsoever in weakening Israel or shrinking its territory. \n\nDo they believe Allah will protect them and lead them to victory ? Israel and the US are two of the strongest military powers in the world. Do they just wish to turn themselves and their population into martyrs? Even from a PR perspective Hamas\u2019 plan has largely failed since no nation has imposed economic sanctions on Israel so far and the genocide accusations are obviously false. If you\u2019re planing to exterminate a group you don\u2019t warn them before military strikes and vaccinate their children for Polio. \n\nA war with Iran or a broader regional war would be disastrous for the Iranian regime and lead to so many more deaths. I hope eventually peace and stability can return to the region. The US military seems to be relatively uninvolved in the current conflict and have not said they will assist Israel push Hezbollah out of southern Lebanon. Is this because there\u2019s an election coming up or do they naively believe it\u2019s possible to make peace with an internationally recognized terrorist group like Hezbollah?  \n\nWhat do you think is the correct response to the aggression Israel has faced so far? What should they be doing, if anything, to avoid a regional war? Will Iran retaliate after so many members of Hezbollah were killed ? ",

AIPAC wants House Democratic members to state explicitly that they \u201cstand with Israel\u201d in its actions against Iran aimed at destroying the Islamic Republic\u2019s nuclear capability, and add that Iran \u201cmust never have a nuclear weapon.\u201d\n\n>  \nIn addition, AIPAC has taken particular pains to denigrate the moderate pro-Israel group J Street, both in private conversations with members of Congress and in public, picking a fight aimed at blocking any Democrats from using J Street as cover to deviate from AIPAC\u2019s maximalist position. \u201cThey\u2019re worried their members in Congress may start to shift toward J Street and they\u2019re trying to head that off,\u201d said an aide to one Democrat.\n\n>\u201cI did see that AIPAC took issue with my\u00a0[statement](https://x.com/RepJayapal/status/1933356964320333946),\u201d said Rep. Pramila Jayapal of Washington state. \u201cThey were taking on J Street for endorsing me, which was ridiculous.\u201d To get a sense of how extreme AIPAC\u2019s demands are, note that J Street\u2019s own\u00a0[statement](https://jstreet.org/press-releases/j-street-statement-following-israeli-attack-on-iran/)\u00a0merely calls for diplomacy while still supporting Israel. \u201cWe urge the Trump Administration to meaningfully pursue a diplomatic resolution to this conflict as quickly as possible while making clear the US will do what is necessary to defend Israel and US troops from retaliation,\u201d the statement read.\n\n>AIPAC\u00a0[issued the same tweet](https://x.com/AIPAC/status/1934004595686101077)\u00a0in response to any statement that fell short of its expectations, such as one by\u00a0[Rep. Greg Casar of Texas,](https://x.com/RepCasar/status/1933334585376715266)\u00a0which called for a diplomatic resolution: \u201cConsistent pattern: J Street endorsees issue anti-Israel statements. u/jstreetdotorg is many things, but it\u2019s not pro-Israel.\u201d\n\n>The messages reflect one way special interests shape policies in Washington, where a conforming statement is a metric lobbyists can cite to show their dominance. While not everyone received this bombardment of communications from AIPAC officials\u2014particularly progressives who have made their views known about Israel\u2019s actions\u2014judging by a substantial portion of House Democrats, the effort appears to be having an effect.\n\nThis is all clipped from the linked article at the top, but you should really read the whole thing. It is outrageous how much AIPAC bullies members of Congress that do not immediately send out full support of Trump and his actions in Iran. Kind of shocking we allow lobbies to have this much influence over our politicians. ",

Danny was the lawyer for Elizondo. It would make sense that he could know things like this from their attorney/client privilege. Also, Danny is not bound to their security clearances. He can just go publicly say what he knows and he doesn't have to say who his source is, but it seems pretty obvious.

High-ranking military officials and scientists were killed with their families, with Israel trying to create an environment of fear where everybody could be potentially hit.\n\nIran is receiving no official support from any government, besides empty denouncements of naked Israeli aggression. Russia has their hands full with their own war against the imperial core, and China has shown time and time again that they will not involve themselves in any sort of international dispute, not even barring genocide. If anything, Iran has been the ONLY sponsor of containing Israeli aggression in the past 20 years, by supporting the Syria, Hezbollah and Yemen.\n\nMeanwhile, Israel has had full backing of their allies, both in word and deed. Western governments toe the American/Israeli line that Iran has been escalating, the US and the UK have been involving their airforces in protecting Israeli airspace, Jordan is shooting down Iranian missiles and turning their civilian population into debris victims. Western governments are selling the most developed military tech to Israel at a discount, and let's not forget the nuclear elephant in the room.\n\nDespite all this, they decided to retaliate in force and terror bomb Tel Aviv. The Israeli Ministry of Defence compound has seen significant destruction, the Iron Dome has been outed for the fraud it is. Zio settlers had to run to their shelters multiple times and are playing victim on social media right now. I've seen footage of Fox new reporters running away once they realised the Iranian missiles were penetrating defences, stuff I've never seen before in my almost 30 years in this hellscape.\n\nSo I am very disappointed to see many fellow socialists and communists denounce the Iranian leadership for being 'too meek' and the Iranian response for having been 'too muted', even after the attacks on Tel Aviv! I've seen people unironically expect the Iranian government to shoot down Netanyahu's plane over Greece. \n\nI think many people rightfully feel extreme anger and hatred towards the Zionist entity, as do I, but it's very typical for western leftists to want to risk global south proletarians in order to vent this anger. Iran is constantly risking imperial core boots-on-the-ground intervention. Half of the elected US officials have made it their last wish to see Iran burn, that Holden Bloodfeast meme isn't ironic. Iran has to be very careful and measured in their response if they don't want to end up fighting a Western invasion.\n\nObviously this intervention would never end well, the US is even more incapable of waging a major sustained land offensive than they were at the time of Iraq, and Iran is a country with 4 times their population covered mostly in mountains. But it would cost millions of Iranian lives, which is what they Iranian government is rightfully trying to prevent.\n\nThe only chance they have right now is hyperfocusing all of their efforts in actually developing nuclear weapons. Until they do, they will be stuck there they are now, being unable to retaliate accordingly without risking full-scale intervention",

I'd really appreciate your insights or corrections if you see things differently.\n\n1. **Iran vs. the West (led by the USA)**: Iran has long been at odds with the West, especially the U.S., and has extended its influence in the region by supporting groups and governments in Iraq, Syria, Lebanon (via Hezbollah), and Gaza (via Hamas). Some believe that Hamas overplayed its hand recently, potentially at Iran's urging. In response, Israel now views Iran as an existential threat and seems determined to weaken or even overthrow the regime in Tehran.\n2. **The nuclear question**: As far as I can tell, Iran does *not* currently possess nuclear weapons. Yet the West (especially Israel and the U.S.) has used the fear of a nuclear Iran as justification for preemptive strikes and broader efforts to destabilize the regime\u2014similar to the narrative used before the Iraq War with Saddam Hussein.\n\nI'd also love to hear your thoughts on the **U.S.\u2013Israel relationship**.

    "title": "I wrote a 40 page essay describing why Israel was not morally justified in bombing Iran, with links",
    "text": "The link is [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vRvsk63eC34v8MrHNCvNqoXinmx7AQHNdM43yWJqXhDshf4qbEAfUpyQmTSKbLcGczfGsnUeyMxbhR0/pub). It is a Google Doc so when accessing links you may have to open them in a private window, as [archive.is](http://archive.is) does not play nice with Google Docs. Originally it was 23 pages, because I finished it on June 22, the same day Trump decided to bomb Iran. This is a \"second edition\" that includes an expansion on what I think Netanyahu's true motives are, as well as a brief addendum discussing Trump bombing Iran. I wrote this solely to organize my thoughts, nothing more. I sent the first draft to Destiny, figuring there was a 2% chance of him actually reading it, but now I figure it's probably closer to 0.01% so I am sharing it here.\n\nTL;DR\n\n1. Israel's main claims to justifying the bombings, are that Iran was posing an immediate threat through its accelerated uranium enrichment, as if the 60% uranium stockpile was enriched to 90%, that can be weaponized.\n2. There is no evidence, anywhere, that Iran possessed 90% enriched uranium or was actively weaponizing. The Israeli government doesn't even make that claim.\n3. The problem with this argument, is that Iran already possessed enough 60% uranium-235 to produce a nuclear bomb (if enriched to 90% uranium-235) back in November 2022. It increased this stockpile several times, to the point where it could produce 2 bombs in 2023 and 3 bombs in 2024. This means this \"immediate threat\" existed for two and a half years, yet Iran never weaponized its uranium at any point.\n4. So this naturally leads to the question, \"why bomb Iran now?\" The strongest possible argument to this, is that Israel may have gained \"secret intelligence\" sometime in 2025 to justify bombing Iran.\n5. There are multiple problems with this argument, however. For one, Netanyahu and the Israeli government never make any definitive claims about whether or not Iran is actually weaponizing its uranium. They speak almost entirely in hypotheticals (i.e. Iran could have a bomb in a few months, in a year, etc). If they had definitive intel that Iran was weaponizing its uranium or enriching it to 90%, we would expect the Israeli government to make definitive, confident claims (such as Iran IS producing nuclear weapons). To compare, the Biden administration was very definitive in claiming Russia would invade Ukraine \"in the coming week.. in the coming days\".\n6. There is also nothing stopping Israel from releasing at least *some* intel to verify their claims. Again, the Biden administration was willing to declassify some satellite imagery to show Russian troop movements.\n7. There is also nothing stopping Israel from sharing their intel with US intelligence, so US intelligence could corroborate their claims. Bafflingly enough, American intelligence was already aware Israel was planning on bombing Iran at least as far back as February 2025. So Israeli intelligence was willing to share battle plans, but for some inconceivable reason, could not share the intel justifying the bombing itself.\n8. An alternate argument is that Iran acquiring so much uranium can act as a deterrent towards Israel - so long as there is always a threat Iran can nuclearize, this may restrict Israel's military actions against Iran's proxy groups (such as Hamas, Hezbollah, and the Houthis)\n9. The problem with this argument is that Iran already had enough uranium to produce 2 nuclear bombs in 2023, and 3 nuclear bombs in 2024, yet this did not deter Israel's military actions against these proxy groups. Furthermore, if Iran building a nuclear weapon is truly an existential threat, we would expect Israel to prioritize targeting Iran first, as that would be the greatest threat.\n10. The Israeli government brings up these proxy groups as an imminent threat to Israel, when trying to justify the bombings, but does not establish at all how bombing the uranium enrichment facilities affects these proxy groups or how they are connected in any way\n11. Bombing Iran's uranium enrichment facilities is a short-term solution, various experts believe even if Fordo was destroyed, Iran could rebuild in a matter of years because Iran already has the knowledge of enriching uranium, which is truly hard to \"kill\". It can have unintended consequences, such as pushing Iran to weaponize faster, or relying on more covert means.\n12. The only real advantage of bombing the uranium enrichment facilities is \"buying time\". But buying time for what? Without a long-term strategy it isn't meaningful in the end\n13. Another major strategic failure is that Israel did not actually target Iran's 400kg 60% uranium stockpile itself, presumably because bombing that would lead to environmental damage. America now has no idea where it even is\n14. The bombings also thwarted active diplomatic talks in Oman, and America knowing about them in advance suggest the negotiations were bad faith. This is not good for the future, as Iran will now likely also engage in bad faith in future negotiations.\n15. In light of all of the above, bombing Iran does not justify the civilian casualties, especially since Iran was open to negotiations before (through the JCPOA) which was a peaceful alternative that did not lead to civilian casualties, and was willing to continue the Oman talks (which Israel interrupted through its bombings)\n16. One criticism of the JCPOA was that it had sunset clauses after 15 years. While this is also a \"delay\", the reason why these clauses exist is because society and culture change, and 15 years give negotiators wiggle room to reassess if the deal is working or needs to be renegotiated. It is also a delay that does not lead to civilian casualties.\n17. Vague appeals to \"Iranian history with Israel and America\" and arguments that Iran has historically been antagonistic to America and Israel do not apply here and are a red herring. Yes, Iran has funded proxy groups like Hezbollah, Hamas, and the Houthis to attack Israel. That still does not justify bombing civilians, anymore so than arguing that it is justified to kill Americans because the American government historically engaged in forced regime changes, unless you can firmly establish the link from bombing the uranium enrichment facilities to these proxy groups or firmly establish what the strategic objective is that justifies civilian deaths.\n18. I speculate that Netanyahu's motives were mostly political, his coalition was dysfunctional and he needed a way to unite them while taking political pressure off himself\n19. There are various other points and arguments but this post is becoming too long for a TL;DR, I elaborate more in the essay with links\n\n**EDIT: Since most of you are apparently very bad at reading, I have to explain even more points for you, that I already address in my paper, making this TL;DR, paradoxically, even longer**\n\n20. \"Iran had a history of antagonizing Israel and wishing for its destruction you can't ignore that\"\n\n**I don't ignore it, I discuss it.**  \n\"It is true that Iran, historically, has funded and supported proxy groups that have engaged in terrorist attacks against Israel, such as Hamas, Hezbollah, and the Houthis; namely with money, weapons, training, and intel. Regarding the proxy wars of 2023, the [Washington Post reported](https://archive.is/2aWzN)\u00a0that various Western and Middle Eastern intelligence officials believed Iran gave Hamas \u201cmilitary training and logistical help as well as tens of millions of dollars for weapons\u201d although they admitted \u201cthey have no firm evidence so far that Iran authorized or directly coordinated the attack that killed more than 900 Israelis and wounded thousands.\u201d There was also evidence that Hamas [attempted to contact Iran](https://archive.is/f5xxB)\u00a0in advance of the October 7 attacks, and although a senior Iranian commander claimed to support Hamas\u2019 actions in \u201cprinciple\u201d, the declassified documents have suggested Hamas carried on the attacks without Iran\u2019s actual support.\"\n\n\"Iran is not blameless, as they, too, have engaged in retaliatory strikes against Israel through drones and ballistic missiles (which have harmed civilians) and have had a history of engaging in proxy wars with Israel through groups such as Hezbollah, Hamas and the Houthis. Based on recent reports from the IAEA, they are being deliberately opaque and noncompliant with their uranium enrichment program and have more than doubled their 60% enriched uranium stockpile over the course of a single year. While this warrants vigilance, Israel has not provided any compelling evidence of Iran\u2019s nuclear proliferation, which is the main justification behind their attacks that carry the weight of civilian casualties. Based on publicly available evidence, Iran, if anything, seemed to have deliberately chosen to not\u00a0enrich their uranium to 90% over the course of several years, perhaps to serve as a bargaining chip for future negotiations, as a deterrent, to secure more regional influence, or some combination of all of the above\"\n\n**However, it is a red herring in the context of the bombing itself because the Israeli government does not explain how, strategically, bombing the uranium enrichment facilities affects any proxy groups in the area. If you say \"well Iran bad, therefore, it's okay to bomb them and get civilians killed\" this is literally a \"he was no angel\" argument, you can use this to justify bombing America and killing American civilians because of America's history of forced regime changes and funding proxy groups as well. Killing civilians is not justifiable unless it fulfills a legitimate long-term strategy that justifies killing those civilians in the first place, which I argue, Israel has failed to elaborate on.**\n\n**If your argument is unironically \"well it's war, Iran started this war Israel can just kill whatever civilians they want\" this is another unhinged argument, which for some reason is very popular here. Morally speaking, if Israel is going to perform military actions that will harm civilians there has to be a strong reason for it besides \"Iran bad\". That is an important aspect of a \"just war\".**\n\n21. \"Israel didn't bomb Iran before, because they were preoccupied with proxies, which were weakened in 2025\"\n\n\"My criticism of this argument is if Israel genuinely believed Iran was pursuing a nuclear weapon, that would be an actual existential threat to Israel. Netanyahu and the Israeli government have literally stated this themselves. So logically, for Israel it would have made far more sense to prioritize Iran as a military target first, despite the potential risks of escalating proxy groups, since Iran would have posed the greatest threat. \"\n\n\"This line of argumentation is also in contradiction with one of the proposed rebuttals, that Israel was justified in bombing Iran to weaken proxy groups, or because Iran\u2019s uranium stockpile acted as a deterrent to Israeli military operations against those groups. If the argument now is that Israel was too preoccupied striking the proxy groups, that is evidence that Iran\u2019s stockpile at the time (which was already enough to produce one bomb) was not an effective deterrent. Strategically, it is also in contradiction \u2013 if the idea is that bombing Iran\u2019s uranium enrichment facilities somehow weakens the proxy groups, then that would be yet another justification, on top of the existential threat of a bomb, to prioritize bombing Iran first.\"\n\n**To simplify it for you, if Iran's uranium enrichment was genuinely a threat, it would have made more logical sense for Israel to prioritize bombing Iran's uranium enrichment facilities in 2023, because Iran actually pursuing nuclear weapons** ***is*** **an existential threat. The fact that they did not do that, suggests that they did not take Iran's uranium enrichment seriously.**\n\n22. \"Israel didn't bomb Iran before, because Biden didn't want to\"\n\n\"There is, however, one other problem with this line of reasoning. If there truly was a credible, imminent threat of Iran pursuing nuclear weapons, or pursuing 90% uranium enrichment, wouldn\u2019t the Biden administration have permitted, or even supported\u00a0bombings in Iran? It is not only in Israeli security interest for Iran to not pursue nuclear weaponization \u2013 it is also in American and arguably global security interests that Iran is not in possession of a nuclear bomb. However, the United States did not make any mention of Iran potentially pursuing nuclear weapons at all during this period, despite their uranium stockpile exceeding the amount necessary to produce a bomb.\"\n\n**This effectively argues that Biden was intentionally negligent of Iran's threat. I have no reason to believe this is the case, considering A. he was very decisive when it came to acting against Russia invading Ukraine and B. Iran literally didn't weaponize at all during his administration.**\n\n23. \"Yeah, but they had 400kg of 60% enriched uranium!\"\n\n**Iran already possessed 62kg of 60% enriched uranium in 2022, 114 kg of 60% enriched uranium in 2023, and 182 kg of 60% enriched uranium in 2024. If that was all enriched to 90% uranium-235, that is enough for 1, 2, 3 nuclear bombs. Yes, Iran has more uranium now and** ***accelerated*** **the enrichment of 60% uranium. However, the threat from 9 potential nuclear bombs, is not meaningfully different from 1, 2, or 3 nuclear bombs. If the quantity of the stockpile necessitates urgency, then Israel should have bombed Iran years ago, because the greatest threat, by far, is 1 nuclear bomb. If the acceleration of the uranium stockpile warrants urgency, Israel has not demonstrated or explained how this is a unique issue, compared to any other year. This undermines the idea that bombing Iran was done because Iran was posing an \"immediate\" threat.**\n\n**Additionally, if the goal is nuclear weaponization why didn't they just... enrich their preexisting uranium to 90%? Why didn't they do that for multiple years? Why sit on a 60% stockpile? I argue, it is likely because they wanted to use it as a bargaining chip for future negotiations with the US, and as a (failed) deterrent.**\n\n24. \"But Israel did bomb Iran before\"  \n**No, they did not recently bomb Iran's uranium enrichment facilities. They bombed Iran's consulate at Damascus, which led to Iran retaliating in October, and a further retaliation from Israel. This has no relevance to anything I've discussed.**\n\n25. \"TL;DR lol\"  \n**You all mock Hasan for having shallow political takes and not reading things, yet here you are, engaging in the same behavior. You all claim to favor rationality and strong argumentation, yet don't engage with meaningful arguments. The \"pragmatic\" \"rational\" community, everyone.** **Israel bombing Iran is a complicated issue involving moral frameworks, geopolitics, and multiple countries, of course I can't summarize everything in a handful of sentences.**\n\n**EDIT 3: I would like to give a special shout out to** u/Parablesque-Q, [who tried to argue that Just War theory doesn't matter or apply to Israel, because no one abides by it in the Middle East](https://imgur.com/XYt7XHB)[, which implies that he believes Israel is morally justified to kill virtually anyone they feel like for any reason](https://imgur.com/EgHtMfD)**, since Just War theory demands distinction between combatants and non-combatants, proportionality, military necessity, and so on when considering whether or not military actions are morally justified. He may have genuinely failed to understand that Just War theory is** [an ethical framework](https://iep.utm.edu/justwar/)**, not a legal one (although it has influenced international law, and following international law is part of the ethical framework as a \"competent authority\"), which truly reveals his expertise and knowledge.**\n\n**He tried to argue with me that the Assad regime's existence was the reason why Israel didn't want to bomb Iran sooner, and after the regime collapsed, Israel wanted to bomb Iran, even though** [**Netanyahu ordered attack plans for bombing Iran in November 2024**](https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/netanyahu-says-he-gave-order-to-take-out-irans-nuclear-program-in-november-2024/)**, before the Assad regime collapsed, which would imply that his decision to bomb Iran was not related to the Assad regime collapsing. Instead, he kept screeching at me about how the attack was set in April, which has nothing to do with what I'm arguing about, the obvious point being made was that Netanyahu started plans to bomb Iran before the Assad regime collapsed, yet apparently he couldn't grasp that very simple argument.**\n\n**Good community here, guys!**",

If the nation of Israel knew Donald Trump, they would get rid of Netanyahu and keep replacing him until they got somebody that Trump liked.  \n\n\\-The Israelis are all happy as larks at the thought of the United States going to war with Iran.  Have they forgotten what Trump said about the war in Iraq?  Trump said that going into Iraq is the stupidest thing than an American president has ever done.  And he believes that Bobo was behind that. Whether Netanyahu was behind that or not--I don't know.  What I know is that Jeffrey Sachs thinks that and Trump posted a video of Jeffrey Sachs saying that.\n\nHas everybody forgotten about how Trump talked up going to war with North Korea?  Trump believes in taking extreme positions in negotiations--and that is probably good advice.\n\nRight now Netanyahu is saying Trump has been the best president for Israel.  Trump will point that out in the future.  \n\nDonald Trump will not go to war with Iran.  Trump is letting his flunkies plan for a war, but Hegseth has said that Trump told him, \"Tell me about action you are planning to take 24 hours in advance.\"  This is not going to be like when Rumsfeld and Cheney forced Bush to go along with them.  No troops have  moved over there, have they?\n\nTrump knows he can't rely on his flunkies to come up with any war plan.  Those guys are rank amateurs and Trump knows it.  Trump picked them exactly because they are rank amateurs.  It does not matter to Trump because Trump will make all the decisions.\n\nPeople make a big deal out of the B-2s at Diego Garcia.  Our B-2s can attack any spot in the world from any spot in the world.  When they attacked Iraq they flew in from some place like Nebraska.  Those B-2s have sleeping quarters--one bed--and cooking equipment.  The stealth technology in B-2s is about 40 years old.  They used to stay in the air space of the United States 100% of the time in order to give no opportunity for anybody to test out radar frequencies on them, and they attacked from the United States and flew back to the United States.  Now I guess we know they can be detected by radar, so what does it matter if we fly some to Diego Garcia?\n\nThe United States and Iran have been talking through backchannels since at least the time that Israel attacked the Iranian embassy.  \n\nIran has said they are not building atomic bombs and that they do not intend to build atomic bombs.  We would know if Iran built a bomb just like we knew that Israel had built bombs.\n\nIf we did go into Iran, Israel would feel the destruction of war for the first time because Iran has thousands of missiles and Iran has hypersonic missiles--according to ChatGPT.\n\nChatGPT also confirmed that Israel knocked out Iran's air defenses--using JPost as it's source.  But when I asked if Israeli jets flew into Iranian airspace, ChatGPT said they did not enter Iranian airspace..\n\nEven if Israel had knocked out all of Iran's air defense--that was last October.  How long would it take Iran to get a system up and running?  It would take as long as it took Russia to deliver the S-400 system.  The S-400 system is on wheels.\n\nThe United States is not going to war with Iran.  The thing is, even if we did go to war with Iran and made Iran look like Gaza, Israel's problems wouldn't be solved.  There's still Turkey and Egypt.\n\n",

    "text": "With the recent Israel-Iran war I'm trying to understand China\u2019s long-term strategy here. The US, NATO, and Israel have been actively reshaping the world military interventions, regime change, economic warfare, and building networks of vassal states and puppet leaders across the Middle East, Africa, Eastern Europe, Asia and beyond.\n\nMeanwhile, China seems to be taking a much more passive, economic-focused approach. They build infrastructure, offer loans, and talk cooperation but they don\u2019t intervene when the West destabilizes regions, installs client governments, or ignites proxy wars.\n\nHere's my concern:\nIf this continues unchecked, won\u2019t China eventually find itself completely surrounded? Economically strong, I guess but isolated politically and strategically, with no real allies and everyone else under Western influence or coercion.\n\nAnd if the U.S. is clearly preparing for conflict with China who's going to back China when it finds itself cornered? Yes I agree that it\u2019s impossible to militarily conquer China but if the West has everyone on the globe as their proxies then it becomes very easy to isolate and cripple China, without a war or conflict.\n\nSo my questions:\n\nIs China playing the long game wisely, or passively watching the net tighten?\n\nShould it be more active in supporting anti-Western powers or forming counter-alliances (BRICS+, Iran, Syria, etc.)?\n\nWhat happens if everyone else has already been bought or bullied into siding with the West by the time China is forced to fight?\n\nGenuinely curious how others see this.",

    "text": "Something doesn\u2019t add up.\nThe U.S. just launched a strike on Iran using B2 stealth bombers. These things had to fly across the planet, refuel multiple times in midair, and operate with a fleet of about 125 support aircraft. The whole trip took over 30 hours.\n\nNow here\u2019s the weird part. If we believe the claims made by military insiders, whistleblowers, and even some declassified documents, the U.S. has had access to advanced propulsion systems for decades. We\u2019re talking about craft that can defy gravity, move silently, evade all radar, and cross continents in minutes. Some people call them TR-3Bs or black triangles. Whatever the name, these vehicles are supposed to exist.\nSo why are we still sending 1990s bombers around the world with fuel tankers like it\u2019s World War II?\nThat raises three possibilities:\n\n1. The advanced tech doesn\u2019t exist.\n2. It exists, but it doesn\u2019t work well enough to be used in combat.\n3. It works, but it\u2019s so secret that they won\u2019t risk exposing it, even during war.\n\nPersonally, I think it\u2019s number three. These systems are probably operational but are kept so far off the books that using them would cause a political and scientific earthquake. You can\u2019t just unveil a flying triangle over Iran without blowing the lid off the entire secrecy structure.\n\nSo what do you think?",

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu alleges that Iran is on the verge of building a nuclear weapon, a claim he has made repeatedly for the last 30 years. Iran responded with a barrage of missiles, and the two sides have been exchanging volleys since.\n\n>Trump had reportedly urged Netanyahu not to attack and allow talks between Iran and the president\u2019s Middle East envoy to continue. After the attack, Trump expressed support for the move and has fired off a series of bellicose posts about Iran. On Monday, he cryptically warned all 10 million residents of Tehran to \u201cimmediately evacuate\u201d the capital. The next day, he suggested he could assassinate Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and also posted simply, \u201cUNCONDITIONAL SURRENDER!\u201d The president also appeared to suggest that the U.S. is already involved, claiming, \u201cWe now have complete and total control of the skies over Iran.\u201d\n\n>Levin, a Fox News weekend host, joined Tuesday\u2019s Hannity, where he tried to rally viewers behind military action on Iran. He mocked those who suggested a U.S. attack could lead to a wider war in the region or the world:\n\n>\"The Israelis are kicking their *sses left and right and the U.S. hasn\u2019t even gotten involved directly. Yeah, so where are they? They\u2019re nowhere! How about China? Nowhere! How about Russia? Nowhere! What happened to World War III? There is no World War III! They all sound like a bunch of Marxist Islamists. They don\u2019t sound like patriotic Americans!\"\n\n>\"Let me be clear. This is good versus evil. You\u2019re either a patriotic American who\u2019s gonna get behind the president of the United States \u2013 the commander-in-chief, or you\u2019re not!\"\n\n>Levin went on to slam Rep. Thomas Massie (R-KY), who introduced a resolution aiming to prevent the president from attacking Iran without consulting Congress.\n\n>He added: \u201cFolks, this is black-and-white. You\u2019re either on the side of the red, white, and blue, or you\u2019re on the other side. It\u2019s that simple.\u201d",

    "text": "What\u2019s fascinating (and disturbing) is that while Ted Cruz and others in the White House justify their loyalty to Israel using vague religious claims, people like Sam Harris, a staunch atheist and secular thinker, also defend Israel\u2019s actions with equally unexamined zeal, just through a different lens.\n\nSam Harris doesn\u2019t invoke the Bible or Torah, he invokes Western Enlightenment values, rationalism, and the idea that Israel is a \u201ccivilized democracy\u201d surrounded by barbarism. He has repeatedly argued that:\n\n* Israel is \u201cmorally superior\u201d in its conduct of war.\n* Civilian casualties in Gaza are largely Hamas\u2019s fault.\n* Western liberals are hypocrites for criticizing Israel while ignoring other regimes.\n\nBut what makes this parallel so striking is:\n\n* Cruz uses faith to rationalize violence.\n* Harris uses reason to sanitize it.\n\nBoth ultimately erase Palestinian suffering.\n\nBoth refuse to hold Israel to international legal standards.\n\nAnd both use their platforms to morally exceptionalize one nation\u2019s violence while demonizing the victims of another.\n\nSo whether it\u2019s:\n\n* \u201cThe Bible says bless Israel\u201d (Cruz),\n* or \u201cThey\u2019re the rational democracy in a sea of madness\u201d (Harris),\n\nthe outcome is the same: unquestioned U.S. support for Israel, religious or secular, no matter the cost.",
